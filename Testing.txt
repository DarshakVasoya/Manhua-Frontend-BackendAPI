 pkill -f "uvicorn"
nohup uvicorn main:app --reload &

A "502 Bad Gateway" error from Nginx means it cannot connect to your FastAPI backend. Common causes:

1. **FastAPI server is not running**  
   - Check with: `ps aux | grep uvicorn`
   - If not running, start it: `source venv/bin/activate && nohup uvicorn main:app --reload &`

2. **Wrong port in Nginx config**  
   - Make sure Nginx is proxying to the correct port (default is 8000).
   - Check your Nginx config: `sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default` (or your custom config).

3. **Firewall or network issues**  
   - Ensure nothing is blocking port 8000.

4. **FastAPI crashed or errors**  
   - Check logs: `tail -n 50 nohup.out`

To resolve:
- Make sure FastAPI is running and listening on the port Nginx expects.
- Restart Nginx: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
- Fix any errors in your FastAPI logs.
